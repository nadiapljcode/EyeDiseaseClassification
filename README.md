# EyeDiseaseClassification
A deep learning project that classifies various retinal diseases from fundus images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project leverages image augmentation and CNN architecture to assist in early diagnosis by accurately identifying retinal conditions.

## 📌 Features
- Multi-class classification of retinal diseases from eye images
- Data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization
- Custom CNN architecture built with Keras and TensorFlow
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Visualization of model training progress and confusion matrix using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.7
- TensorFlow & Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 Project Structure
retinal_classification_final.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with full workflow (data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation)
- Dataset/ – Dataset folder with images sorted by disease classes
- SelectedImages/ - Consists of folders each representative of classes ( ODC, DR, MH, Normal)
- model/ – Saved model weights and checkpoints
- testImages/ - Contains images that will test the performance of model

## 🚀 Getting Started
- Clone the repository rflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
- Run the notebook:
    - Execute step-by-step cells for data preprocessing and augmentation
- Train the CNN model on the dataset
- Evaluate the model’s performance with metrics and confusion matrix visualization
